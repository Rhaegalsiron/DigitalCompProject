### Running the App

1. Clone the repository:

   cd DigitalCompProject
   ```

## üîß How It Works (Brief)

1. On first launch:

   * Creates SQLite database `ecommerce.db`
   * Builds tables: `users`, `products`, `discount_codes`
   * Inserts sample products and discount codes (if the products table is empty)
   * Ensures `images/` folder exists

2. The app starts at the **login screen**. You may choose to **register** if you don‚Äôt have an account.

3. Once logged in, you‚Äôre presented with the **store interface**:

   * Filter products by category
   * View images, names, and prices
   * Add to cart

4. In the cart section:

   * View the list of added items
   * Enter a discount code and apply it
   * See updated totals

5. Click **Checkout** to finalize:

   * Displays final amount
   * Clears the cart for a new session

## üìã Sample Discount Codes

| Code          | Type    | Value | Description                |
| ------------- | ------- | ----- | -------------------------- |
| `SAVE10`      | PERCENT | 10    | 10% off the total          |
| `DISCOUNT10`  | PERCENT | 10    | 10% off the total          |
| `DISCOUNT01`  | FIXED   | 1     | \$1 off the total          |
| `FREESTUFF!!` | FREE    | ‚Äî     | Everything becomes free üéâ |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Caveats

* Ensure that product images (PNG) are placed correctly inside the `images/` folder for them to display.
* Sample products & discount codes are only inserted when the `products` table is empty.
* This app is intended for **demonstration / educational use**, not production use.

Do you also want me to **add installation screenshots / UI preview images section** (so your GitHub looks more visual), or keep it clean text-only?
